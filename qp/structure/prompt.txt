Great! That means we now have a fully protonated PDB with the OXO and Succinate called 5ybo_protoss.pdb.
However, we still need to updated two files called 5ybo_ligands.sdf and charge.csv to reflect adding the OXO's.
Let's start with the file file "5ybo_ligands.sdf".
This file contains a the sdf files for all ligands in the PDB.
So now that we have created a new OXO ligand (HOH's are omitted) we need to manually add the OXO's to this file.
As some background, while this file lacks all information on the OXOs it does have info on the succinates, which looks like this.

The way it names each sdf structure is residue name, chain, and residue number, OXO_A_304.
Thus for the OXO, the three code which is OXO, the chain of that OXO, which is A in this example, and the residue number which is 304.
It should add SDF structures for all OXOs that are created by this script.
The sdf file should be very simple since the OXO is a single atom
